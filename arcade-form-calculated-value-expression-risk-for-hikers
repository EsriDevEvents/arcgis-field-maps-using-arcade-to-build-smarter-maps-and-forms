The logic in prosa
For erosion, cracks and ligthning strikes:
If the tree health issue is erosion, cracks, ligthning strike and the proximity to the hiking trail is less than 3 meters, the risk for the hikers is very high
If the tree health issue is erosion, cracks, ligthning strike and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 3 and 6 meters, the risk for the hikers is high
If the tree health issue is erosion, cracks, ligthning strike and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 6 and 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is moderate
If the tree health issue is erosion, cracks, ligthning strike and the proximity to the hiking trail is bigger than 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is low
For pest:
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is low, the risk fo the hiker is low
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is moderate, the risk fo the hiker is low
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is high and proximity to the hiking trail is bigger than 10 meters, the risk fo the hiker is low
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is high and proximity to the hiking trail is between 6 and 10 meters, the risk fo the hiker is moderate
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is high and proximity to the hiking trail is between 3 and 6 meters, the risk fo the hiker is high
If the tree health issue is Pest and the pest severity is high and proximity to the hiking trail is less than 3 meters, the risk fo the hiker is very high
For wind damage:
If the tree health issue is wind damage and the proximity to the hiking trail is less than 3 meters, the risk for the hikers is very high
If the tree health issue is wind damage and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 3 and 6 meters, the risk for the hikers is high
If the tree health issue is wind damage and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 6 and 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is moderate
If the tree health issue is wind damage and the proximity to the hiking trail is bigger than 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is low
For Leaning:
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is less than 30°, the risk for the hikers is low
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is between 30° and 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is bigger than 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is low
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is between 30° and 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 6 and 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is moderate
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is between 30° and 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 3 and 6 meters, the risk for the hikers is high
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is between 30° and 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is less than 3 meters, the risk for the hikers is very high
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is bigger than 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is bigger than 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is low
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is bigger than 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is between 6 and 10 meters, the risk for the hikers is high
If the tree health issue is leaning and the leaning angle is bigger than 60° and the proximity to the hiking trail is less than 6 meters, the risk for the hikers is very high
For Fungal infection:
The risk fo the hiker is low
